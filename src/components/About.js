      <p>
        Hi, I’m Eya REjeb, a passionate and versatile creative professional with a strong foundation in design, web development, and data science.
        I love merging technical precision with imaginative thinking to build thoughtful digital experiences and tackle real-world challenges.

      <p>
        My journey has always been driven by curiosity and a desire to learn, create, and grow. Whether it’s crafting clean, responsive interfaces or
        diving into data to extract meaningful insights, I’m always excited to bring ideas to life through code and creativity.
      </p>

        Beyond the screen, you'll often find me behind a camera lens, making music, or contributing to community projects that make a difference.
